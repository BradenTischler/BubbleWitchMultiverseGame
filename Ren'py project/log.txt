                    [elated]
                    Well, one day I wasn't, and then I was. There's not much to tell there. Oh, but so much in between! Yes, that's the space I like.
                    When I was born, the vivacious place full of life you see was barren, if you can believe it! It was a barren field of grass and dirt, if
                    you could believe it, but it stretched out for miles, so many miles you could walk back to the place you started! and see nothing but a planet of grass! 
                    One day, I hit my foot on something — something other than the brobdingnagian expanse, anyway — and I saw a little brick with little smaller bricks inside of it. 
                    There was nothing there, of course, but my mind knew the word: book. I read the, {i}book{/i}, and it told me I was the "Witch of the Mind," whatever that meant. 
                    It said I was in charge of this world and that it must be shaped and filled with people.
    
                    {clear}
    
                    [neutral]
                    I didn't know what "people" meant before I wasn't the only one, of course. But for the time being, I started to make rules for this place: "an object in motion must
                    stay in motion," "eukaryotic cells have nuclei," that sort of thing. Eventually, from these rules, other people were made. At first, I talked to them about the way people
                    should treat each other. At first it was simple: "don't hurt people." But then others starting to say, "don't do things that cause harm." Our minds started to rail against each
                    other, and eventually, philosophy was born from that dialectic. I was so invested, I started to forget the rules. Eventually, we figuered out how to work through them, though.
                    That was science. Science was hard, but it was hardest for me, because I was remembering what I had forgotten. I began to mourn my lost memories.
    
                    {clear}
    
                    [concerned]
                    I saw people making mistakes; doing the wrong things. They challenged me, and sometimes they were right, but I was impatient with them and, really, myself. I started to
                    rule them with a rod of iron, enforcing on them a strict sense of justice and a need to adhere to the rule of their superior in the hierarchy that I put myself on top of.
                    It worked, to some extent: people got things done. But they also grew fearful, so fearful they weren't really able to go any further with things. I began to realize that I
                    was hurting them because I was hurt, not because they needed it. I realized that people need autonomy, so I gave them that.

                    They got better after they had a sense of self, and after we all realized that complicated things have nuance.
