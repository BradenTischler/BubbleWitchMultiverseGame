    Hi there! Hope the job's going okay, and you're settling in! Just a quick thing you need to know:

    {clear}

    The entire multiverse has been collapsing the entire time you've been on the job, and we're all going to 
    die if we don't stop an interdimensional moon from destroying all worlds. 

    {clear}
    
    Sorry, should have lead with that! 
    
    {clear}

    We call it the Literal-Embodiment-of-Hate-Rock here because, well, it starting coming at us when the bubble witches outside of
    the interdimensional realm started to isolate themselves and become fearful of others' ideas. No idea how {i}that{/i} happened! 
    Again, so sorry! Thankfully, though, it's both the literal embodiment of hate {i}and{/i} a rock! Which means: you just need to 
    get some of the bubble witches together and blow it up! Of course, if you could get at least a core trio of them together to 
    ward it off forever, that would be ideal.

    {clear}

    Don't worry, though! If you get at least two of them together, at least that much should be enough of a starting point to start off with!
    Again, again, sorry, sorry! It's just so weird adjusting to being a transcendental essence that can only communicate cryptically! Ciao brutta!
    """

    "Well..."
    "...that's not ideal."
    "But, wait, did you not do good on getting everyone together?"
    "And wait.." # flash
    "is that..." # flash
    "YES!! Some of your friends have come!" # flash if you got the good ending.
