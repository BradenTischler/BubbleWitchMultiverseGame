[Player enters the world; the G. WITCH appears, an androgynous character with sparse
pink hair standing in a tall plume at the top of their head. They are wearing comfortable 
but archaic Feudal-European robes, and they stand in an observatory filled with abaci,
Napier's Bones (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier's_bones), and other outdated 
manual mathematical instruments]

G. WITCH: Hark! Who enters my lair!

PLAYER: The witch of the nether-bubble realm.

G. WITCH: And what is your import?

PLAYER: I don't know.

G. WITCH: Well, I will have you know that those of little import...
[beat]
...are completely welcome here!

PLAYER: Well, I suppose I shouldn't say that. I'm important, apparently. A book said so.
I just don't really know *why*, outside of the whole witch thing. Which is fine I guess.

G. WITCH: Well, don't define your worth by some crusty old book! Come, come! All are welcome here!
All your ideas are welcome! Please make yourself at home!

PLAYER: Alright.

A tiger whose back is smeared in meringue riding a unicycle on a bouncing ball that's 
cheered on by a seal.

G. WITCH: Of course, of course! I'll fetch the mage at once!

PLAYER: ...that was a joke. I didn't know the multiverse could actually get that weird.

G. WITCH: Oh, it was a completely ludicrous suggestion! But ludicrous is welcome here!
All ideas are welcome here! Have what you want, and it shall be made!

PLAYER: No, no. I'm good.

G. WITCH: Of course you're good you're amazing! You're here! Isn't life a wonderful thing!?

[dialogue options]
1. Yes, it is! You're right! We're all amazing!
2. Don't worry, I'm easy to please.
3. I take it back. Tiger. Meringue. Now.
	
Branch 1:
	
	G. WITCH: Oh, magnificence! I see we agree! Isn't agreement wonderful!?
	
	1. It is!
	2. It is, but people have to disagree sometimes, don't they?
	3. No. I hate you. Tiger. Post-haste.
	4. What are all these doohickeys
	
	Branch 1:

		G. WITCH: Wonderful! Stay as long as you like! You are always welcome here!
		
		Narration: You spend the rest of your life in blissful happiness with your new comrade. Which is [time elapsed].
			The world goes black and you don't know how it ended. BAD ENDING
				# Obviously not how we'd actually implement this, since we agreed on four endings. This just seemed like a natural

				# the rock a secret would obviously be a bit hard, and these gag endings might discourage people from taste-testing up

	Branch 2:
		G. WITCH: I was like you once. Always so dilligent and naïve. But I got stuck in my ways. I know to open up now.
		
		1. Good for you! Keeping an open mind is amazing!
		2. Yes. I'm not naïve. Which is why I get a tiger. Now.
		3. You are literally disagreeing with me right now.
